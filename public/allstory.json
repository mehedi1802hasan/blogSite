  "description": "With any practice that involves bettering yourself, there comes a whirlwind of counter-intuitive anxieties that can create stumbling blocks. If you’re new to the gym world, the gym can feel like the most intimidating place on earth. Here’s how you can deal with your gymtimidation. Choosing Your Gym: The place where you work out is as important as the workout itself. Do thorough research into how convenient the gym is, what services and benefits are available, what precautions and hygiene practices are followed if they cater to both genders and what the capacity is like. Don’t be afraid to ask plenty of questions. You can also ask for a trial day to see what the gym is like at your ideal workout time. Usually, gyms will be more than happy to give you a full tour and answer any questions you may have. A gym membership can be a big commitment, so it's important to know everything about the space you will frequent- and it can help when dealing with gymtimidation."

Defeat in Melbourne at the age of 36 led to him deciding to retire, ending a 19-year tennis career. In 2010 he had reached a world ranking of 31. In 2013 he had beaten Roger Federer at Wimbledon, ending the champion's run of 36 consecutive Grand Slam quarter-final appearances. He knew what his next step would be. He brought his family back to Budapest in Hungary, where they live. His wife asked what he was going to do. It was not the answer she wanted to hear and she got upset, Stakhovsky says. \"I played Davis Cup with pride for almost 17 years so I honestly don't see how I could be the privileged one to stay out of what's going on in my country.\""

  "description": "There are several things we could say and then just stop and you’d, of course, run to the kitchen with no explanation because YUM. Like, “creamy parmesan risotto” or “tender, juicy, garlic & lemon marinated jumbo shrimp” or “pan-seared and draped in a bright lush pesto.” But honestly, what if all of that was part of the same dish and you were already head over heels about it? It’s true, it’s true. The risotto is tender and rich and feels so special, the subtly sweet perfection of the quick-marinated shrimp is sealed in with a golden brown sear. The pesto, oh the pesto…fresh, zippy, full of warm summer basil flavor. This one’s a treat. Have you met our truest best friend of pastas and jarred sauces, DeLallo? What dreamboats they are. Just, they never disappoint! Sometimes jarred pestos can be kind of overly creamy and a dullish green, which can feel a little meh when you are hoping for wow. But DeLallo’s jarred pesto is much brighter, fresher, less creamy, and the flavor is definitely very wow. It uses handpicked basil, olive oil, crunchy pine nuts & cashews, garlic, Pecorino Romano AND Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses, so HELLO FLAVOR PARADE! Def recommend getting a few jars of this on hand for yourself. And because pesto doesn’t require any kind of cooking/heating, it really, really is best to just use at the very end of cooking to maximize all of its fresh flavors!"

  "description": "Titans captain Pandya took 3-17, including the prize scalp of England's Jos Buttler for 39 to restrict Royals to 130-9 and then hit 34 from 30 balls. Shubman Gill top-scored with 45 not out and the India batter hit the first ball of the 18th over for six to win the match in front of a record crowd of almost 105,000 people in Ahmedabad. The Titans triumph was built on a good draft: Mohammed Shami, Rashid Khan, Lockie Ferguson, and Pandya combined to make up an excellent bowling attack, with batting power coming from Gill, David Miller, and Matthew Wade. But putting a group of talented players together does not automatically bring success, and Pandya has expertly led them from the front despite captaining in the IPL for the first time."

  "description": "A lot of people stress over bigger issues in society, like drug addiction, obesity, violence, overpopulation, education disparity, and much more. You may be one of the people who sit at home caught between the silver lining of those issues. But did you know that many people, most especially teenagers, are suffering from fashion pressure? Some feel inferior about themselves for not keeping up with the trendsetting slaves of fashion. But should you feel bad about yourself for not doing so? No, because after all fashion is not always about following the fashion gods and goddesses. Fashion is also about expressing yourself in ways you are comfortable. According to Erik Erickson, a developmental theorist, finding the personal identity is at the peak of adulthood. Teens struggle to find their identities because they preoccupy their minds with acceptance from others. Ultimately, fashion pressures come from the influence of friends, parents, and magazines."

But travel blogs make these choices easier by sharing tales from the road to reviews on the best places to stay to what to expect from the locals. Travel blogs remain firmly in the top ten slots of most popular blogging niches. Today we look at who travel bloggers are, what successful travel blogs look like, and whether you think this blogging niche is for you? Travel bloggers take on many shapes and sizes from digital nomads, backpackers, photographers, and writers, to chefs, venture capitalists, and modern-day adventurers, the list goes on. These adventurous souls make traveling a lifestyle choice. And it makes sense that travel blogs stay so popular. Travel bloggers give those of us who want whimsy from the comfort of our couches, a beautiful daydream of what it is to “Live on the Road”. But they also offer a service."

  "description": "There are a wide range of working conditions and employment opportunities within interior design. Large and tiny corporations often hire interior designers as employees on regular working hours. Designers for smaller firms usually work on a contract or per-job basis. Self-employed designers, which make up 26% of interior designers, usually work the most hours. Interior designers often work under stress to meet deadlines, stay on budget, and meet clients' needs. Other areas of specialization include amusement and theme park design, museum and exhibition design, event design (including ceremonies, weddings, baby and bridal showers, parties, conventions and concerts), interior and prop styling, tablescape design, theatre and performance design, stage and set design, production design for film and television. Beyond those, interior designers, particularly those with graduate education, can specialize in healthcare design, gerontological design, educational facility design, and other areas that require specialized knowledge."

        "description": "Everybody on the Web says you shouldn’t party too hard. Why are people so like-minded? It’s because there are numerous cases when students didn’t just screw their trips up but ruined their lives and their future because of student parties abroad. We are not here to scare you, but as a foreigner, you seem more vulnerable than others. This can make you may get hurt. Besides, alcohol, hormones, and burning emotions can lead you astray.\n\nEven if you don’t get in trouble, you are sure to regret the time you spent having hangovers instead of studying.\nNeglecting Networking\nYou still have to communicate a lot with your fellow students. Some of them can become your real friends; others will make useful acquaintances beneficial to your future career. Please mind that parties can be the right way to make friends, as long as you are cautious. But there is quite some choice of other activities that help you to get in touch with other students: volunteering, amateur activities, like student theaters, various student organizations, etc. Besides, it is quite important to stay in touch with your foreign teachers as well. Who knows, maybe someday you’ll have the opportunity to work in this country? So, useful contacts can contribute to your success. After all, you can always email your teachers and ask for some advice about the subject you’ve been studying.\n\nNormal image\nHaving Prejudices!\nThe opportunity to study abroad may be one of the most exciting things in your life. You can’t ruin it with any prejudices. Don’t be afraid that locals won’t be kind to you and don’t fear of the language barrier. Narrow-minded people never get the benefit of such journeys. For them, it is just another point on their checklist. But the experience is not just about going abroad to study at a particular school; the essential experience is about letting a different culture and different people teach you something valuable.\n\nNormal image\nTo cut a long story short, the main mistake you can make while studying abroad is going to extremes. Listen to your heart, plan, but stay flexible, be open to something new, but don’t forget about your health, make friends, but don’t let new acquaintances influence you negatively."

        "description": "These shiny, nutty seeds have an earthy aroma and a host of health benefiting properties. I first came across this wonder seed while reading up on hair health. Experts seem to agree that if you need some help with hair fall and want to grow your hair, there is nothing like a regular dose of flaxseeds. Initially, I had a little difficulty in cultivating taste for it in its raw form, but my love for it grew after a while. You don't really need to load up on flaxseeds, a little helping is enough. Experts and nutritionists recommend a tablespoon of flaxseeds a day to meet your essential, daily nutritional requirement.\n\nThe benefits of flaxseeds\nHowever, you need to be watchful of the way you consume flaxseeds. Flaxseeds are brown in colour and come with a hard, crunchy covering. Flaxseeds, if not chewed properly would render no benefit to your body, this is one of the biggest reasons why many like to soak it before consuming or simply have it in the ground or powdered form. The benefits of flaxseeds are in abundance.\n\nNormal image\nThese nutty delights come packed with a bevy of health benefits. \"Flaxseeds are a great source of soluble mucilaginous (gumlike) fibre that can lower unhealthy cholesterol (LDL) and and balance blood sugar levels. It also acts like hunger suppressant and helps you feel full for long. Their high omega-3 fatty acids content can help lower undesirable fats (triglycerides) in the blood, reducing the risk of stroke and heart attack. flaxseeds are also good for eye health,\" as mentioned in.\n\nDorling Kindersley's book Healing Foods\nFlaxseeds are enriched with some of the most essential and basic nutrients that our body requires. These come enriched with fibre, protein, magnesium, calcium, phosphorous, lignan among other nutrients and minerals. Lignans present in them help in battling high levels of estrogen and help in maintaining balanced hormonal levels. Since flaxseeds are energy-dense with great satiety value, these make you feel full and therefore facilitate weight management.\n\nNormal image\nFlaxseeds are great for women's health\nRegular consumption may help reduce menopausal symptoms and can also help tackling irregular periods and menstruation-linked discomfort. Women should make the best out of these alsi seeds benefits. There has been quite a lot of debate on how should one consume flaxseeds."
